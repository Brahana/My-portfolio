# My-portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio website repository! ðŸš€

This repository contains the code for my personal portfolio website, built using HTML and CSS. The website consists of two main pages:

Home Page: Introduces visitors to who I am, my skills, projects, and any other relevant information.
Contact Page: Provides visitors with a means to get in touch with me, whether it's for collaboration, job opportunities, or just to say hello.
I've designed this website to showcase my skills, projects, and interests in a clean and professional manner. Feel free to explore the code, suggest improvements, or use it as a reference for your own projects.
